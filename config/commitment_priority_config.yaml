priority_weights:
  time_pressure: 0.30      # 30% weight
  severity: 0.25           # 25% weight
  amount: 0.15             # 15% weight

# Time Pressure Factor (days until due)
time_pressure:
  scoring:
    - days_remaining: 0      # Overdue
      score: 100
    - days_remaining: 1      # Due today/tomorrow
      score: 95
    - days_remaining: 3      # Due in 3 days
      score: 85
    - days_remaining: 7      # Due in 1 week
      score: 70
    - days_remaining: 14     # Due in 2 weeks
      score: 50
    - days_remaining: 30     # Due in 1 month
      score: 30
    - days_remaining: 90     # Due in 3 months
      score: 10

# Severity Factor (domain-based risk)
severity:
  domains:
    Legal: 10                # Highest risk (lawsuits, compliance)
    Finance: 8               # High risk (late fees, credit)
    Health: 9                # Very high risk (medical urgency)
    Compliance: 10           # Regulatory requirements
    Admin: 5                 # Medium risk
    Personal: 3              # Low risk

# Amount Factor (logarithmic scale)
amount:
  thresholds:
    - min: 0
      max: 100
      score: 10
    - min: 100
      max: 1000
      score: 30
    - min: 1000

    - min: 100000
      max: null              # $100k+
      score: 100

# Effort Factor (estimated hours)
effort:
  scoring:
    - hours: 0.25            # < 15 minutes
      score: 10
    - hours: 1               # < 1 hour
      score: 30
    - hours: 4               # Half day
      score: 60
    - hours: 8               # Full day
      score: 80
    - hours: 16              # 2+ days
      score: 90

# Dependency Factor
dependency:
  has_blockers: 50           # If blocked by other commitments
  blocks_others: 80          # If blocking other commitments
  no_dependencies: 0         # Independent task

# User Preference
user_preference:
  flagged_important: 20      # User manually marked as important
  default: 0

# Reason String Template
reason_template: |
  {time_reason}{severity_reason}{amount_reason}

  # Examples:
  # "Due in 2 days, legal requirement, $12,419.83"
  # "Overdue, high financial risk"
  # "Due in 1 week, blocking 3 other tasks"
