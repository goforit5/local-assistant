All set! I dropped a full “unicorn-grade, all-local” microservices architecture onto the canvas—including a dedicated Claude Code agent runtime, plus error taxonomy, structured logs, tracing, metrics, dashboards, and runbooks.

Want me to generate a starter repo layout and a ready-to-run docker-compose folder (with example skills.yaml, OTel config, and Grafana dashboards) next?
